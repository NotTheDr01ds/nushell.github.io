# This Week in Nushell #283 and #284

Posted Thursday, 2025-01-30.

## Front Matter

With this edition, TWiN transitions to being a regular post on the main Nushell blog and Discord server. We encourage you to share and repost on your preferred social media platforms.

Due to this transition, we're playing catch-up and covering the last 12 days of contributions. The next edition is planned for Saturday, February 8th, with a focus on the following 9 days.

Quick note: Issue #280 was accidentally posted two weeks in a row, and #281 was skipped. Expect #281 in the archives soon!

## Highlights

Reminder: We're now on a six-week release cycle. The next Nushell release (0.102) is scheduled for next Tuesday!

This week brings us more completion improvements, the new `version check` command, the ability to Rickroll (or perform far more practical actions) directly in Nushell via `start` with application URIs, a friendlier renamed `format number` command (`fmt`), and more!
